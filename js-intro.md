# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: 
  A function is a reusable piece of code, saving you time and computer resources by not having to recreate function code separately

  Researched answer:
  A function is a collection of instructions. These instructions can take paramters and output return values.


2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: A map will create a new array using each item of an array. A filter is used to create a new array, using items from an array that match the filter's criteia.

  Researched answer:
  The map method is used to apply a function on every element in an array. A new array is then returned.
  The filte method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.


3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: Console.log() is single use and is its output is designed to be seen only by the programmer. A user can not see the results of a Console.log without using a developer tool. A return can be called on many times and its data can be used elsewhere in code. With some code, a user can be given a return value. 

  Researched answer: The console.log is used to print something on the console whereas return command is used to return a value from a function to the line where the function has been called. 


4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: The settings you're giving the function throught the parenthesis.

  Researched answer: Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is utilizing a 2 role team to create code. The advantages of this method include how developers can complement each other's skills, covering for either's deficiencies, and strengthing their partner's proficiency by knowledge sharing. Like long distance car rallies, pair programming involves a driver and a navigator. The driver is in control of the team's coding device's inputs, driving the code on the screen. The navigator spots hazards (coding mistakes) and guides the driver with the map (project documentation, research, etc.) Roles are switched between developers on a predetermined basis.
  
  It is also more productive to talk through coding challenges with a pair partner than using the rubber duck method. 

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
  
  While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.


6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: Test Driven Development, places a 3rd driver into a pair programming team. This driver is a testing suite that will only accept code that works for the current objective and will fail code that does not meet its expeceted results. TDD constrains developers from going on tangents writing novel solutions, provides front line QA, and prevents feature creep.
  
  Researched answer: Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved so that the tests pass. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. 


7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Harrison said we should make the time to study 20 hours a week so while looking for more exercises to do I found out about Udemy's course sale and picked up some bargins.
